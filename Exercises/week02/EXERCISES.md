# Exercise 1: Database Queries
_Goal: Learn how to perform database queries using SQLite._

In this exercise, you will practice performing various database queries using SQLite. You will work with the `exams.sqlite` database and write queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

Files needed:
- `db/transcript.js`
- `db/queries.js`

# Exercise 2: Promises and Async/Await
_Goal: Understand how to use Promises and async/await for asynchronous operations._

In this exercise, you will learn how to handle asynchronous operations using Promises and async/await. You will refactor existing code to use these modern JavaScript features.

Files needed:
- `db/queries_sync.js`
- `db/queries_promises.js`
- `timeout.js` (This file demonstrates the use of `setTimeout` to execute a function after a specified delay, which is useful for understanding asynchronous operations.)

# Exercise 3: Q&A
_Goal: Implement a Q&A system with questions and answers._

In this exercise, you will create a simple Q&A system where you can add questions and answers. You will also implement methods to filter and sort the answers based on different criteria.

Files needed:
- `qa/es3_qa.js`
- `example_vehicles.js` (This file demonstrates how to filter, map, and reduce an array of objects, which can be useful for manipulating and analyzing data in the Q&A system.)
